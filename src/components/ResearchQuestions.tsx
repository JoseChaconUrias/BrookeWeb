        <p>
          One of the key features of bacterial T4P systems is their ability to
          mediate multiple, distinct molecular mechanisms (e.g. bacterial
          aggregation, DNA-uptake, surface motility, host-cell adhesion). The key
          question here is how are these mechanisms regulated in C. difficile? In
          this study, we hypothesize that mutants of T4P genes pilJ and pilW,
          which show defects in biofilm formation, will show normal or near-normal
          twitching motility. The central question is whether the loss of these
          accessory pilin proteins disrupts pilus extension or retraction. Related
          to this question, the expression of T4P and flagella are inversely
          regulated in C. difficile. We hypothesize that riboswitch mutations,
          that are known to increase flagellation, will correspondingly decrease
          piliation and twitching motility and vice versa.
