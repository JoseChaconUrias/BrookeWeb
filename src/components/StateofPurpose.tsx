          Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile) is a Gram-positive,
          spore-forming bacterium that is the most common cause of nosocomial
          infections, also referred to as healthcare associated infections, in the
          developed world. This bacterium does not easily colonize a healthy human
          colon, but a depleted microbiota due to antibiotics provides a perfect
          environment for C. difficile to thrive.

          We want to study a specific characteristic of C. difficile that is
          referred to as Type IV pili (TFP). Pili have various functions including
          bacterial interactions with surfaces and contributing to the
          pathogenicity of bacteria. TFP are hair-like appendages that appear on
          the exterior of the bacterial cell and are not limited to just C.
          difficile. These appendages can expel away from the cell giving the
          bacterium many abilities including communication, motility, adhesion to
          surfaces or other bacteria, and genetic exchange. TFP formation is of
          peak interest as the functions of this extracellular mechanism are
          widely unknown in C. difficile. There are different genes that code for
          specific proteins that make up pili (pilA, pilJ, pilW, etc.) and they
          perform different functions for the pilus. We want to focus on two
          wildtype genes that code for proteins pilJ and pilW. We hypothesize that
          the pilJ and pilW mutant strains will show normal twitching motility
          whereas the pilA mutant will show no motility. Different species of
          bacteria have various mechanisms to move over surfaces. Some bacteria
          can “glide” over surfaces by protruding an extracellular appendage,
          adhering to the surface, and retracting said appendage, which is known
          as twitching motility. The motility of bacteria depends on the
          concentrations of media they are in; some species cannot move in soft
          agar, but others can move successfully in a more concentrated media.
          Some species contain flagella but present flagella-independent motility
          through twitching by extension, adhesion, and retraction of TFP. TFP
          twitching motility has only been exclusively studied in gram-negative
          bacteria although gram-positive species, including clostridia, have TFP
          biosynthesis genes and TFP-dependent twitching. One successful species
          closely related to C. difficile, Clostridium perfringens, has been shown
          to use TFP-dependent twitching motility which leads us to believe C.
          difficile is able to as well.

          Biofilms are clusters of bacteria that are resistant to drug treatment
          and immune responses and they promote persistence of infection in many
          pathogens. C. difficile is predicted to be very resistant to antibiotic
          treatment because of the build-up of biofilms within the colon. Based on
          previous knowledge that TFP have a role in biofilm production, we
          believe TFP have a role in the colonization of C. difficile in the gut.
          Specific toxin molecules that can be found in the gut, like deoxycholic
          acid, can induce C. difficile biofilm formation although these
          mechanisms are still unknown. Deoxycholic acid can also increase the
          expression of pili in C. difficile, we want to know if this toxin
          impacts twitching.
