          After five days, the assay results will be interpreted based on visual
          spread of the bacteria strains in and on different concentrations of
          agar. The flag off will be compared to the flag on, the pilW and pilJ
          mutants will be compared to the wild types. The results will confirm if
          the pilW or pilJ proteins have an affect on biofilm formation in C.
          difficile. If the bacteria can move in the agar, there will be a large
          ring of bacteria on the top of the agar or on the bottom of the plate.
          Measuring the diameter of the bacteria spread will be how we determine
          if the bacteria is able to twitch. To analyze the results of the biofilm
          assay, we will be using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test and
          a spectrophotometer to measure the biofilm`s density. The methods will
          be repeated if the results are inconclusive. This data will collectively
          identify if C. difficile can create TFP and whether the production of
          TFP contributes to biofilm formation and motility.
