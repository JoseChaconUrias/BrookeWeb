          C. difficile is a highly infectious disease that affects half a million
          people each year in the U.S. The infection often occurs in hospitals
          after the use of antibiotic treatment and can cause inflammation of the
          colon, leading to diarrhea and sometimes permanent damage to the colon.
          Recurrence and mortality rates have increased due to hyper-virulent
          strains of the bacterium that are becoming more resistant to
          antibiotics, causing a worldwide health emergency. There is much to be
          uncovered about C. difficile, specifically how it adheres to the gut.
          Fecal transplants have been successful in helping treat C. difficile
          infections, but we don`t know why exactly the treatment works. It may be
          because our natural microflora plays a role in the colonization of C.
          difficile or that the formation of biofilm contributes to antibiotic
          resistance. It is speculated that the intestinal epithelium wall becomes
          stiffened due to inflammation from the attachment of C. difficile, which
          also promotes bacterial movement and dispersal across a harder surface.
          Understanding the mechanisms of adhesion of the bacterium in the gut, as
          well as its interactions with other microbes, will help create effective
          treatment of this deadly disease. The goal of this research is to
          identify whether an epidemic strain of C. difficile, R20291, has the
          capability of using twitching as a form of motility.

          This experiment will immerse me into an advanced lab setting where
          required courses cannot teach me and will set me up to successfully
          continue academic research in my future. I will learn to present and
          communicate my research with other students from different fields
          including biochemistry, microbiology, and food science. I will be
          working under two advisors, Dr. Kurt Piepenbrink and Dr. Jennifer
          Achtung, to conduct this research.
