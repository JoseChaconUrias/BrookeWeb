        <p>
          The experiment will consist of three stages: 1) molecular biology 2)
          bacterial growth 3) motility assays. In the first step, glycerol stocks
          will be made from different strains of R20291 including: flag off, flag
          on, pilW mutant and wild type, pilJ mutant and wild type. The media to
          culture the bacteria will be made based on how easily R20291 can move in
          the agar concentration. The media will be filter-sterilized instead of
          autoclaved to keep the media fresh and prevent brunt media that could
          affect the experiment's results. The second step is where we`ll culture
          bacteria to isolate them for the twitching and biofilm assays. A
          quadrant streak of each strain will be inoculated on fresh 1% BHIS
          containing 1% glucose. The plates will be set in the anaerobic chamber
          to grow because C. difficile can only survive in oxygen-depleted
          environments. The bacteria will be allowed to grow for 16-18 hours in
          the chamber and will be determined if it is viable to use in the
          motility assays. The growth stage will be repeated until we have optimal
          bacteria growth and colonies form. These bacteria will be stabbed
          through our specific media onto the plate beneath or will be lightly
          stabbed on the agar to grow on top of the agar. The plates will be
          wrapped in a plastic lining to prevent evaporation and promote motility
          when they are being stored. For the biofilm assays, colonies from the
          plates of C. difficile will be diluted in 1:100 fresh BHIS containing 1%
          glucose. The biofilms will grow for 16-18 hours in untreated tissue
          culture plate wells that have reduced in the anaerobic chamber for at
          least 72 hours.
